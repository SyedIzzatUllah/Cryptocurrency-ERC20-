# What is ERC-20?
ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment. Essentially, they are standards that have been approved by the community and are used to convey technical requirements and specifications for certain use cases.

ERC-20 specifically is a standard which outlines the technical specification of a fungible token.

"A fungible token is one in which all 'parts' of the token are the same. Exchanging 1 ETH for a different 1 ETH doesn't change anything. You still have 1 ETH. Therefore, ETH is a fungible token. All fiat currency is also fungible."

"NFTs are examples of Non-Fungible Tokens (more on this later) where each token is different from a different token."
